### Paul Sorenson - GoodMap

* Works at Grace Hill
* GoodMap has been around for about two years - is there a better way to find/share community resources online - homeless services, United Way 211, etc.
* Information for non-profits better organized so that they can serve low income residents looking for resources
* Developed with Giant Hat on Ruby on Rails over last couple of years
* Search for a category and resources pop up with various refinements (service areas, categories of resource, etc.)
* Right now there are 2,000 resource listings in there - a lot but not nearly all the services out there
* If you have an account you can edit/save/share resources as well as create a "guide" (a collection of resources that you frequently use that can be public or private)
