##New Business

###Code Across
+ Last year we did a small event & filled out our St. Louis Open Data Census [http://us-city.census.okfn.org/place/stlouis](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/place/stlouis)
+ Focus on a data-a-thon for Code Across
+ Data can be stored on our github repo or on our newly-improved Socrata platform, kindly donated to us by Socrata (or we can post to both!)
+ Dates: February 20-22, 2015 [http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/)
+ Location suggestions? 
    + Sasha's on Shaw has a room you can get for private parties
    + The usual suspects: T-Rex, Foam, Gelateria
    + Poll membership? Find a location that could bring new people in.
    + Focus St. Louis as a location & possible co-host? Lots of people interested in St. Louis succeeding - would be nice if they were to adopt open data, open standards, etc.
    + WorldWide Technologies has an amazing tech-friendly meeting center - inviting people who might be their future customers
+ Tell us what data we should liberate!  Stuff you would use if it was open!  Stuff in PDF!  Let's make a massive list of what we want to find/open/etc.
+ Invite contacts to the event who might have super cool data!
+ Code for America will have a variety of challenges as well, including a health challenge - so we may also do that

###Open Data Policy!!!
+ St. Louis County should have an Open Data Policy - EVERYONE in the group comes into play for that, because we are in many ways the regional experts on concepts, policies, and what data users/tech entrepreneurs/etc. may want - let's build a collaborative document and also talk about it/spread it widely among potential partners/experts/etc
+ Let's draft a model policy that can work for any counties and any municipalities in the region as well
+ Bill has the bones of a draft on google drive from a while back
+ Sunlight Foundation(?) or CfA(?) was keeping a list of cities that have adopted policies so we can refer to that
+ Probably any open source software statement is not going to work - probably only sticking to open data
+ Missouri will likely have a variety of state-specific exceptions
+ But we can still make suggestions!

###Next Saturday Work Day 
+ Need to have a formal agenda next time we do that
+ Work on website
+ Need to work with Jon Leek to schedule - he isn't here tonight
+ We could roll next work day together into CodeAcross???
+ YES - we had a show of hands and we're going to do work day sessions as part of Code Across

###Misc
+ Discussion of BioBlitz from Build4STL from last year - working with youth on biodiversity mapping project
+ Question came up about alternatives to ESRI for these sorts of mapping projects?  QGIS, CartoDB, Turf, Leaflet, D3, etc., etc.
+ Zip code vs. ZCTA discussion
+ Remember about our strategic plan! If you haven't seen it, take a look! [https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/StrategicPlan2015](https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/StrategicPlan2015)
+ Fiscal Focus is being modified - Brett welcomes any help!
+ Launching new website! Any help would be appreciated - using Jekyll and GitHub pages.  Also would love content development help.
