Goal
Our goal for year one is to bring an open data policy and initial culture to local government through technological assistance and connection to citizens, non-profits, and the local startup sector.
Transparency first
The driving goal behind the founding of OpenDataSTL was to connect our community with public data. We discover, document, and open to work towards a more transparent government. Many of us have roles as educators, training students, colleagues, co-workers, and community members. From this role, we have learned the importance of widely and broadly available public data to drive training in technology leading to research in civic solutions. Fundamental to this is a strong open data policy backed by a culture of transparency.
Collaboration
At this unique instance in time, St Louis is a region searching for collaboration. St Louis County and City are searching for ways to end the Great Divorce and collaborate between their two governments. This is a symptom of a regional push to end fragmented government silos and create more cross-agency cooperation. This public sector change is paired with the rapid emergence of a startup technology sector. This sector includes many transplant companies that want to connect to their new neighbors in the surrounding community. We already have within our group a nexus of public sector, private sector, and non-profit sector technology leadership perfect for supporting the transformation of our local government culture through technology. 
We can provide policy advice, outreach to the community, and the technical expertise to unlock datasets and implement standards to support new civic applications.
