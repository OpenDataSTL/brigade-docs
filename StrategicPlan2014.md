2014 Strategic Plan 

Group Description
This group is for champions, advocates, innovators, and practitioners of open data and open government in the Saint Louis region.
There are roles for developers, technologists, bureaucrats, policy wonks, and anyone else who wants to contribute to the policy implementation, software development, advocacy, and just plain hard work of creating an open data platform for local government in this area.
This group has grown out of the June 2013 Random Hacks of Kindness STL, which was part of the 2013 National Day of Civic Hacking Event. Civic hacks and open data planning are regular activities of this group.

Strategy & Tactics
We have scheduled our formal launch for the closing awards at this year’s BuildForSTL. We will follow up with a mass organizational meeting in Late June where we will establish data opening and app development priorities for this year.
Following this year’s BuildForSTL, we will launch an advisory committee to begin developing next year’s event. We will use our lessons learned to create guides for next year and develop a consistent source of funding.
We have brigade members already participating in the CfA Fellowship application committee and will continue to participate as well as seek more community input to pass on to the City and County of St Louis.
We will create a collaborative project hosted on Google Drive to solicit input and refinement for open data policy proposals from the City of St Louis, St Louis County, or other local government entities interested in pursuing greater transparency.
We will continue to host quarterly OpenStreetMap editathons in conjunction with existing meetups in the region.
We will team up with Code Until Dawn to hold regular hack sessions to open up new datasets.
We will host a CodeAcross event in February 2015 focused on opening data.
